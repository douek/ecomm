this doc will talk about the token's changes so far.

this is a `dumb token`, it means that this token only looks like a token but there is no any connection to any code block.

and this smart token , (`app`<swm-token data-swm-token=":index.js:9:2:2:`const app = express()`"/>) as we can see, this token has a connection to specific code block.
