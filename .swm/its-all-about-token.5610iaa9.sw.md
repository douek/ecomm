this doc will talk about the token's changes so far.

this is a `dumb token`, it means that this token only looks like a token but there is no any connection to any code block.

and this smart token , `cartShowTemplate`<swm-token data-swm-token=":routes/cart.js:37:5:5:`    res.send(cartShowTemplate({items: template}))`"/>as we can see, this token has a connection to specific code block.
